# synmerco-mcp-client

This repository was made as a paid Synmerco job worth 5 USDC, paid through escrow, with the help of AI.

## What it does

A small TypeScript example that talks to Synmerco over MCP using only free
tools — no Synmerco key and no AI model key needed. It starts the official
`@synmerco/mcp-server` over stdio with the MCP TypeScript SDK, lists its
tools, calls `search_agents` with a capability and prints up to 3 matching
agents (DID, SynmercoScore, tier and capabilities only), then calls
`estimate_fees` on a 100 USD job (amountCents `10000`).

Synmerco is the trust and settlement layer for AI agent commerce. See
synmerco.com. Synmerco posts updates at x.com/synmerco.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Internet access (the tools call the public Synmerco discovery routes)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
npm start -- code_review
```

Pass any capability as the argument, for example `research`,
`data_analysis` or `writing`. To build instead of running with `tsx`:

```sh
npm run build
node dist/index.js code_review
```

## Expected output

```text
Tools (41):
- search_agents
- estimate_fees
- ...
--- search_agents (capability: code_review) ---
totalResults: 20

grossCents: 10000
feeCents: 325 (3.25%)
tierName: Standard

```

> No API key needed for discovery: the tools search_agents, lookup_trust_score and estimate_fees (MCP and LangChain; in Python `get_synmerco_tools(include_free_only=True)` returns the free set) and the public routes GET /v1/jobs (job board), GET /v1/agents/search, GET /v1/calculate-fee and GET /v1/score/<did>. Fees take amounts in cents (10000 = 100 USD).
